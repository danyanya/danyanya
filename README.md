### Hi there!

I'm Danya, a CTO with a Master's degree in CS. For the past 10 years, I've been building Wimark Systems - we develop software for large Wi-Fi networks, similar to Cisco & Meraki for Wi-Fi, but from Russia.

I've traveled an exciting path from Backend Developer to leading a team of 60 people.

I combine the skills of a technical engineer capable of effectively managing people and projects, and a product strategist. I enjoy growing and developing productive cross-functional teams with a healthy atmosphere.

My expertise covers, but is not limited to:

- development - Golang/C/Lua/Python, networking and protocols (Wi-Fi, LTE, MPTCP, MQTT), embedded, cloud, DevOps/DevSecOps, AI/ML, Linux;
- product work - roadmaps, T2M, PMF, custdev;
- process management - agile, processes, timely delivery;
- people management - hiring, mentoring, 1-1s, building personal learning programs.

Feel free to reach out ❤️
